# Solo Project Travel Tracker

## Who

[Nathaniel Millard](https://github.com/nathanielmillard)

## What

This is a project for Turing's Mod 2 solo [final project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html). The goal was to use fetch requests to create a site a user could use to make trip requests, track previous trips, and upcoming trips with a pending or approved status.

## Why
This project was our first implimentation of a "log in" and an opportunity to demonstrate usage of skills like Sass to refactor scss files, fetch api to interact with serve data, accessibility with lighthouse audits, and generally speaking test drive object orient javascript programing.

## How do I use it?
- clone down this repo
- run npm install
- run npm start
- and visit http://localhost:8080/

- Then log in with traveler and a number between 1-50 (ex. traveler23) and password travel2020

## How did it go?
- Wins:
  - a from scratch layout that is responsive with simple code
  - a lighthouse audit of 100%
  - implementing GET and POST requests
- Challenges
  - last minute refactor on where functionality is stored
  - deciding what information should be displayed
  - dealing with a server multiple other students are on
  - generally time

## Where to next?
#### Issues to still address:
- there is not a notification on if a user has incorrect logins
- the dates you can book from should be more flexible
- the form doesn't clear when a user requests a trip

#### Things I would love to see:
- the agent interface
- modals for the previous trips
- user input after a trip passes to record some of the experience
- the ability to make new user profiles
- the ability to connect users taking the same trip
